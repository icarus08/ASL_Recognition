# ASL_Recognition
Designing Convolutional Neural Network model to detect ASL using Google Colab

## Dependencies Used
- Pandas
- Numpy
- PyTorch
- Seaborn
- Kaggle
- TorchSummary
- Split-Folders

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project was created by the owner of this repository. It is available on Kaggle as the ASL Alphabet Dataset. https://www.kaggle.com/grassknoted/asl-alphabet

## How it works
Running the notebook on Google Colab will train the CNN model for the dataset and save the trained model on the drive too, which can be downloaded locally. The notebook also presents insights to the dataset used and evaluation metrics such as Confusion Matrix, Accuracy, Precision and Recall.

## Instructions
- ASL_Recognition.ipynb is the only notebook to be used.
- Google Colab account might be required to run the notebook which can be accessed by clicking the `Open in Colab` button on the notebook.
- It works using the GPU provided by Colab so a dedicated GPU isn't needed.
